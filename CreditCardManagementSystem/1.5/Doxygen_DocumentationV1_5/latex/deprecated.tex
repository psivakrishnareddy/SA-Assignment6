\item Added Enhanced Balance Retrieval Method\+: Introduced get\+\_\+balance\+\_\+v2 method to replace the deprecated get\+\_\+balance method. This new method provides enhanced functionality for retrieving the account balance based on specified criteria such as date range, transaction type, and merchant. It offers more flexibility and control over balance calculation.
\item Improved Transaction Filtering\+: Refactored the \+\_\+filter\+\_\+transactions method to handle filtering based on various criteria such as start and end dates, transaction type, and merchant. This enhances the flexibility and usability of transaction filtering, allowing users to extract specific subsets of transactions as needed.
\item Updated Payment Initiation Process\+: Enhanced the initiate\+\_\+payment method in the \doxylink{namespace_credit_card_manager}{Credit\+Card\+Manager} class to simulate a payment process by updating the account balance based on the transaction amount. This provides a more realistic scenario for handling payment transactions within the system.

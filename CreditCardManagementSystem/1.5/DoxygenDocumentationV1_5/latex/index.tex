Welcome to the documentation for the Credit Card Management API version 1.\+5! This API provides a set of functionalities for managing credit cards, transactions, and accounts within a financial system. It offers developers the tools they need to build secure and efficient applications for handling credit card-\/related operations.\hypertarget{index_features_sec}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Key Features}{Key Features}}\label{index_features_sec}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Credit Card Management\+: Create, retrieve, update, and delete credit card information.
\item Transaction Management\+: Record transactions, retrieve transaction history, and update transaction details.
\item Account Management\+: Manage user accounts, including adding and removing credit cards, and retrieving account information.
\item Authentication and Authorization\+: Authenticate users and authorize sessions for secure access to API endpoints.
\item Balance Tracking\+: Introduces functionality to track the current account balance based on transactions.

\hypertarget{index_enhancements_subsec}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Enhancements}{Enhancements}}\label{index_enhancements_subsec}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added Enhanced Balance Retrieval Method\+: Introduced get\+\_\+balance\+\_\+v2 method to replace the deprecated get\+\_\+balance method. This new method provides enhanced functionality for retrieving the account balance based on specified criteria such as date range, transaction type, and merchant. It offers more flexibility and control over balance calculation.
\item Improved Transaction Filtering\+: Refactored the \+\_\+filter\+\_\+transactions method to handle filtering based on various criteria such as start and end dates, transaction type, and merchant. This enhances the flexibility and usability of transaction filtering, allowing users to extract specific subsets of transactions as needed.
\item Updated Payment Initiation Process\+: Enhanced the initiate\+\_\+payment method in the \doxylink{namespace_credit_card_manager}{Credit\+Card\+Manager} class to simulate a payment process by updating the account balance based on the transaction amount. This provides a more realistic scenario for handling payment transactions within the system.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_deprecated_features_subsec}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Deprecated Features}{Deprecated Features}}\label{index_deprecated_features_subsec}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Deprecation of get\+\_\+balance Method\+: Deprecated the get\+\_\+balance method in the Account class using the \begin{DoxyRefDesc}{Deprecated}
\item[\mbox{\hyperlink{deprecated__deprecated000001}{Deprecated}}]decorator. This method is replaced by the get\+\_\+balance\+\_\+v2 method, which offers an upgraded version with enhanced functionality.\end{DoxyRefDesc}

\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_security_enhancements}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Security Enhancements}{Security Enhancements}}\label{index_security_enhancements}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Token-\/\+Based Session Management}}\+: Implemented token-\/based session management using randomly generated tokens and session expiration times to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to API endpoints.
\item {\bfseries{Password Hashing}}\+: Enhanced user authentication by securely hashing passwords using the SHA-\/256 algorithm, protecting user credentials against breaches and unauthorized access.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_authentication_improvements}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Authentication Improvements}{Authentication Improvements}}\label{index_authentication_improvements}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{User Authentication Method}}\+: Added the {\ttfamily authenticate\+\_\+user()} method to the {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_credit_card_manager}{Credit\+Card\+Manager}} class for secure user authentication based on user ID and password, enhancing the security of login processes.
\item {\bfseries{Session Authorization}}\+: Strengthened session authorization mechanisms within the {\ttfamily Session} class, enabling developers to verify the authenticity of user sessions and prevent unauthorized access to API endpoints.

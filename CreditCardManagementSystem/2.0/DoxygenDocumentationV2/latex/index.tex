\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed {\ttfamily get\+\_\+balance} Method\+: The {\ttfamily get\+\_\+balance} method in the Account class has been removed to streamline the API and encourage the use of the enhanced {\ttfamily get\+\_\+balance\+\_\+v2} method, which offers advanced functionality for retrieving account balances based on specified criteria.

\hypertarget{index_two_factor_auth_subsec}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Two-\/\+Factor Authentication}{Two-\/\+Factor Authentication}}\label{index_two_factor_auth_subsec}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Enhanced Security\+: Version 2.\+0 introduces support for two-\/factor authentication (2FA) to bolster the security of user accounts. With 2FA enabled, users are required to provide two forms of identification to access their accounts, typically a combination of something they know (e.\+g., a password) and something they have (e.\+g., a mobile device).
\item Improved Account Protection\+: By implementing 2FA, the API enhances account protection against unauthorized access attempts, such as brute-\/force attacks or password breaches. This additional layer of security helps safeguard sensitive financial data and user information.
\item Flexible Configuration\+: The two-\/factor authentication feature in version 2.\+0 offers flexibility in configuration, allowing developers to customize the authentication process based on their application\textquotesingle{}s security requirements and user preferences. Options may include SMS-\/based verification codes, email verification links, or authenticator app integration.
\item Seamless Integration\+: Developers can seamlessly integrate two-\/factor authentication into their applications using the API\textquotesingle{}s authentication endpoints and session management functionalities. The API provides clear documentation and examples for implementing 2FA, ensuring a smooth user experience without compromising security.
